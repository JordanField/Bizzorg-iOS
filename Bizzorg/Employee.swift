/**
 The employee class is the Client equivalent to the Server "`EmployeeProfile`"
 model. It also provides some methods for interacting with the server, such as
 updating the profile picture and converting from the instance to a JSON object.
 
 Properties
 ==========
 
 `username`: User's account name on the server.
 
 `FirstName`: User's first name.
 
 `surname`: User's last name.
 
 `jobPosition`: The job position in the company.
 
 `email`: User's email address
 
 `resourceUri`: The link for requesting this object from the server.
 
 `profilePictureUri`: Link to user's profile picture
 
 `administrating` : List of resource URIs for groups this employee is an 
 admin of.
 
 `profilePicture`: The user's profile picture, or `nil` if the profile picture
 hasn't been loaded into memory.
 
 `isStaff`: Boolean value that denotes whether the employee is part of the
 VIP staff list.

 `fullName`: Computed varible that combines the first and last name of the
 employee.
 
 `id`: Computed variable that extracts the employee's ID from the resource URI.
