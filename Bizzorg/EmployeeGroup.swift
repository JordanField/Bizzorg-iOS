/**
 The native client representation for the EmployeeGroup model on the server.
 
 Properties
 ==========
 
 `name`: The name of the employee group.
 
 `title`: Computed variable that returns a titleized version of the group's
 name.
 
 `parentGroupUri`: The URI of the parent group of this group (that is, the
 group for which this group is a sub-group.) This can be `nil`.
 
 `resourceUri`: The URI for this instance on the server.
 
 `members`: List of tuples for the members of the group. contains two values:
 `admin`, which is a flag for whether this member is an admin of the group, and
 `employee`, which is this member's employee profile.
 
 `membersWithoutAdminFlag`: A computed variable that removes the admin flag
 from the list of employees, leaving just a list of employee profiles.
 
 `id`: Computed variable for the id of this object, extracted from the resource
 URI.
