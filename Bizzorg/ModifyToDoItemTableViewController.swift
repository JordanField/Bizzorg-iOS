/*
 This class, along with ModifyScheduleItemTableViewController, is one of the
 most complex classes in the entire app. It involves both sending and recieving
 data to and from the server, turning native swift objects into JSON data,
 accepting user input in a way that is useful to the user, and dealing with 
 associations like user assignments. be prepared for heavy annotation on this
 file. However since ModifySchduleItemTableViewController is essentialy 
 identical, the annotation on that class will be sparse.
 */

/*
 The UI in these views is very dynamic, as the date and item picker views can
 slide in and out of position. As such, I need a way to easily keep track of
 what cells are where. I do this with a dynamic list of cells that can be added
 to and subtracted from. This way I can append a picker cell to this dynamic
 list, update the table view, then remove the picker view and update the table
 view again when nessecary. However, In the code I need a way to distinguish
 which cells are detail cells and which cells are picker cells. The way I do
 this is by having two distinct enum types for the two types of cells. The
 problem with this, however, is that the strict typing of Swift does not allow
 you to have objects of different types in a list. It does, however, let you
 assign a protocol type to a list. This means that the list can have multiple
 types, but they all must conform to a specific protocol, and the programmer
 has to discern what the type of the object they just recieved is. So in order
 to create this dynamic list I created an empty protocol DetailCellType, which
 I then assign to the InfoCellType and PickerCellType respectively.
*/
protocol DetailCellType {}

/**
 The class responsible for creating and editing to-do items.
 
 Properties
 ==========
 itemTitle - The title of the item to be sent.
 itemDesciption - The description of the item.
 group - The group the item is assigned to. Changing the group property will
 change which employees can be assigned to the item, so a didSet function
 changes the possible employees and updates the table view.
 priority - As name suggests.
 deadlineDate - As name suggests.
 potentialEmployees - This is the list used by the employees section of the
 table view to show which employees can be assigned and gives the user the
 capability of assigning them.
 employees - a list of employees that actually have been assigned currently.
 Used in the table view to add the checkmarks on the cells.
 item - If the user is editing an item rather than making a new one, this
 variable is set to the item they are changing, when this is set, all of the
 other relevant variables are changed to the ones that the item has.
 possiblePriorities - Used by the priority picker view, a list of the priorities
 a to-do item can have.
 groups - used by the group picker view, shows which groups the user can assign
 a to-do item to.
 itemTitleTextField - Will be used to point to the text field the user types
 the title of the item title into so the text can be extracted.
 descriptionTextView - As above, but with the description text field instead.
 dataDateFormatter - Used when building the dictionary to send to the server
 to convert the swift Date object to a standard string representation.
 prettyDateFormatter - Similar to above, but for converting the date into a
 human-readable format for use in the UI.
 detailCells - The dynamic list I was talking about above, this starts with just
 the 4 info cells, but as the user uses this view the list will change as they
 interact with the screen.
